This software is designed to optimize the gaming process in Path of Exile, specifically to create a more comfortable process for buying currency from Tujen. The program is currently in beta stage, and I will try to update its functionality and fix any errors as much as possible. If you notice any issues, please report them to me. You can reach me on Discord at No_drama#3708, or visit my Discord server at https://discord.gg/JP8JDkuUbp.

The program uses OpenCV technology and does not interfere with the game's memory, substitute packets, or manipulate any data within the game. Based on my knowledge, it is impossible to receive a ban for using this program because it cannot be detected by Path of Exile's means. At the time of publishing this program, I tested it for approximately two months, and none of my accounts were banned.

Possible problems when using the program:

I do not have enough data on how well the program will detect images of different currency depending on the manufacturer model of your graphics card, whether it is AMD or NVIDIA. Also, you should make sure that you are not changing any image parameters on your screen such as gamma, sharpness, blur, or post-processing using software. In my case, testing was done on an AMD RX 580 graphics card.

Depending on the resolution of your game window, there may be some inaccuracies in detecting image templates. The resolution on which the program works most correctly is 1920x1080.

I do not have enough data on how well the program will work on DirectX 12 and Vulkan API versions. The program works most stably on DirectX 11. Testing was also done on DirectX 12, and the program worked correctly, but there is still not enough data.

Windows antivirus may not approve of unpacking and opening this program because it sees certain signatures from the Pyautogui library and assumes they belong to the Trojan family.
